This is a small Relational Graph Analytics Benchmark (sRGAB) to test the cababilitites
and the correctness of a relational database that supports graph analytics.

There are three relational tables (airports,airlines, and routes) and x queries.

The data are taken from the OpenFlights Airport, Airline and Route Databases
which are made available under the Open Database License.
